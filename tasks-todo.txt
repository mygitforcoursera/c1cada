1) Get a typical english plain text of around 3000 letters
2) Create code that converts that to runes.
3) Create an encoder that uses Quagmire 1 (converted to use alphabet of 29 runes).
4) Convert that unencrypted rune text encode it using a random keyword length 11, dump result in the perl directory as page.100.txt and test the rune randomness of the encrypted text.
5) Repeat above for 10+ keywords, just to check the randomness is consistant.
6) Create Quagmire 2,3,4 encoders and repeat.

This should prove/disprove the likelyhood of the text being encoded with Quagmire

Continue this approach for any possible encoder.

Continue this approach using prime stream instead of a key, where it is logically possible to use a prime stream.

Try a long keyword, such as the entire Instar Poem as the key.
